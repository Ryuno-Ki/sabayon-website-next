Sabayon 16.11 is a modern and easy to use Linux distribution based on Gentoo, following an extreme, yet reliable, rolling release model.

This is a *major* release that is the result of a hard round of testing, and it is published to mirrors by our build-servers containing the latest and greatest collection of software available in the Entropy repositories.
The Change-log files related to this release are available on [our mirrors](http://dl.sabayon.org/iso/monthly/ChangeLogs/).

The list of packages included in each Sabayon flavor is available inside "*.pkglist" files. Our team is always busy packaging the latest and greatest stuff. If you want to have a look at what's inside our repositories, just go to 
our [packages website](https://packages.sabayon.org/).

All the release variants can be found on the [download section](/download).

# Changes

This Sabayon release is the result of a hard team work, and we wanted to not rush things, providing you a stable, solid, bleeding edge release!
There are a lot of exciting news in this release, here's a few:

* New Anaconda Installer version, with tons of bugfixes
* Latest Kernel 4.7
* Latest KDE-Plasma version
* Renewed artwork
* New Greeter!
* Latest Nvidia and ATI drivers
* New devices added to the supported ARM boards!

Aside from that we also added Odroid X2/U2/U3/C2 to the ARM devices that we support, and thanks also to geaaru we added BananaPi to the lists too. Dailies builds can be found on our mirrors, under the "testing" folder.

Sabayon developers upon common agreement decided to switch to a different release schedule:

* Stable releases will be available in the end of January, May and October; can be still found under the "monthly/" directory in the mirrors, this time span will give us way to test and fix problems that may pop up during the 
upgrades cycles.
* Dailies will always be there, as usual under the "daily" folder and they are just incremental updates, we can't guarantee of their working state all the time.

# New Website

Our old website has been around since the beginning. But we are happy, after a long development period to switch to a more modern and bleeding edge design touch that works out well also on mobile devices.

Until all the posts and content are migrated, you can find a copy of the old site on [](), but be aware, that website won't be upgraded and won't receive love anymore.

If you want to send feedback about the website or want to contribute, join us on IRC or drop an email to []()

# New Forum

We decided also to move our (very, very old) forum from phpBB3 to Discourse, the migration involved topics, posts and users. 

# New developer announcement
